#### Who are you?

Hey! My name is Chase Schachenman and I am currently in my last semester at
University of Wisconsin-Madison. I will graduate in May 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science
and a certificate (read 'minor') in Entrepreneurship. My main area of focus and enjoyment is
web development, with a focus on APIs and back-end.

#### What's on this site?

This site aims to give a brief overview about me. It also provides a place for me to show off
my projects and write about my endeavors in my blog. In addition, it's nice to be able to
show employers that I have spent time to curate my own website.
